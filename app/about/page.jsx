          Robotics involves design, construction, operation and use of robots.
          The mission of a Robotics Club is to spread knowledge about robotics
          and other robotics related aspects. We, MIST Robotics Club, try to do
          so by spreading knowledge about electric motor circuitry, electronics,
          micro controller and programming. The aim of the club is to become a
          platform for all student who are interested in robotics to share,
          combine and spread the knowledge and work together towards greater
          endeavors.

          MIST Robotics Club (MRC) commonly referred to as MRC was established
          on 2013. It is one of the most active and prestigious robotics clubs
          of the country functioning under the supervision of EECE department of
          MIST. MRC arranges national level robotics competitions and workshops
          to help student develop their creativity through creation of various
          types of robots that can be of service to the mankind.
          <br />
          Mist Robotics Club aims to spread the enthusiasm of Robotics among
          students all throughout the country. The club regularly arranges
          routine classes and workshops among freshmen and has arranged
          festivals on the occasion of different days. MRC organizes National
          level competitions with huge participation from universities all
          around the country. MRC believes that beside the sincere efforts
          undertaken by MIST ensure proper engineering education, the club can
          enrich a student’s knowledge of engineering through teaching them to
          apply their knowledge in various problem-solving situations. Mist
          Robotics Club believes that MIST students can do wonders in this field
          as reflected by its motto,

          In January 2012. we some student of MIST had participated in a course
          of Micro-Controller in Pi Labs Bangladesh Ltd. At first, Rahid came
          with an idea of Robotics Club in MIST. He also proposed that we can
          spread our knowledge among all students of MIST as well as can
          implement that. So, we, 6/7 students planned and made a structure of
          the club. And named it Robotic Society of MIST. After recognized by
          MIST Authority, it is named MIST Robotics Club.
